# King of Zombies
A port of ZombiU's King of Zombies gamemode to Garry's Mod. One player plays as "the zombie king" and the rest play as survivors.
Survivors try to survive for as long as they can killing zombies, while the Zombie King spawns different types of zombies around the map.

# How to Play
Place the gamemode folder into the Garry's Mod gamemode folder and select King of Zombies from the game menu. From there you can load into a
game and once friends join you can type ``!select`` in the chat to select the next Zombie King and ``!play`` to start the next round.

# Mechanics
Zombie King is invisible and invincible and flies around spawning zombies wherever he chooses. As zombies damage players he accumulates points
allowing him to spawn more zombies (though he and survivors will gain points at regular intervals).

The survivors gain points by damaging zombies. Once a survivor does enough damage to a zombie they will be rewarded with a random item loaded into the gamemode.

The round ends if the Zombie King kills all survivors.
